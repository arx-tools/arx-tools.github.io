    <p>
      The files you download from the internet are not guaranteed to be safe because they can go through many hands
      before finally landing on your hard drive. When downloading something from the internet you need to keep in mind
      two things: watch out for executables (like <code>.exe</code> or <code>.msi</code> files) and watch out for
      packaged files which's contents you don't see right away. Both of them are fine as long as you don't run them.
    </p>

    <p>Both of the above risks can be mitigated by using tools you already have on your computer.</p>

    <p>
      All files that you can download from this website will have a long string of numbers and letters (as known as a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" target="_blank">hash</a>) provided which is generated by the
      author based on the file's contents. When you download that same file you can also compute its hash and if you get
      the same sequence of numbers and letters then you can be sure that it's the same file and it not have been
      tempered with.
    </p>

    <h2>Checking the hash on Windows</h2>

    <p>Step 1: Download one of the mod files from this site</p>
    <p>Step 2: Open the folder where your downloaded file is</p>
    <p>Step 3: Right click on an empty place and select "Open in terminal" from the context menu</p>
    <p>
      Step 4: Type in <code>certutil -hashfile .\<strong>name-of-the-file-you-have-downloaded</strong> SHA256</code> and
      hit enter.
    </p>

    <p>You will see something like the following:</p>
    <img src="/illustrations/powershell-hashfile.webp" alt="certutil in powershell" />
    <p>
      The characters highlighted on the image in yellow is the file's hash and if it's the same as the hash on the
      file's download page then you are good to go and file is safe to be opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the file's hash doesn't match to what's on the download page, then

    <h2>Checking the hash on Linux</h2>

    <p>Step 1: Download one of the mod files from this site</p>
    <p>Step 2: Open the folder where your downloaded file is</p>
    <p>Step 3: Right click on an empty place and select "Open in terminal" from the context menu</p>
    <p>
      Step 4: Type in <code>sha256sum ./<strong>name-of-the-file-you-have-downloaded</strong></code> and hit enter.
    </p>

    <p>You will see something like the following:</p>
